Very basic calculator, when I was checking out how to build something using react native 

**instalation**
git clone https://github.com/Marujinho/calculator.git
cd calculator
npm install
npm start

**obs**
make sure you have expo cli installed globally in your machine, and that the versions of node and your expo are compatible
