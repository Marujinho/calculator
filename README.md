# calculator

Very basic calculator, when I was checking out how to build something using react native 
<br/>
<br/>

**instalation**

git clone https://github.com/Marujinho/calculator.git <br/>
cd calculator <br/> 
npm install <br/>
npm start <br/>

**obs**
make sure you have expo cli installed globally in your machine, and that the versions of node and your expo are compatible
